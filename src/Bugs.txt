[RESOLVED] Connection reset after first call to server (resolved by while loop)
[RESOLVED] Cannot show multiple lines on client side (resolved by showing one line only)
[REMOVED ISSUE] Bug of not showing the message when not autoFlush is that we are not flushing the message
[REMOVED ISSUE] If we set open to false before printing out the response from server, the response may not be shown on the screen
[RESOLVED] Cannot connect to other host other than localhost (resolved by adding a regex matcher check)
[REMOVED ISSUE] how to enable re-enter ip address or hostname (may not need this)

[URGENT] Multi-threading and Multi-processing to serve multiple clients at the same time
    - When Client connects to Server, we need to create a new Thread for it
    - This happens maybe after the accept() method?
    - And maybe we need multiple sockets instead of universal socket
